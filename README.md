# Singaseong Pinball

Singaseong Pinball is a small static website that hosts a browser-based pinball game. The game is built with HTML5, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript and uses the `<canvas>` element for rendering.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Click **Start Game** to launch the ball.
3. Hit the yellow bumper for bonus points and keep the ball in play to increase your score.
5. When the ball drops below the flippers the game ends and you may submit your score to the online leaderboard powered by a Google Apps Script API.

Have fun and tweak the code to experiment with your own pinball mechanics!
